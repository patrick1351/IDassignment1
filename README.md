This website helps to achieve these things by making the website easy to navigate with aa navbar and a footer while keeping a simple look so that people are able to focus on the information proerply and clearly.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
